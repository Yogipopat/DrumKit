2. Click on the drum buttons displayed on the page, or press the corresponding keys on your keyboard (w, a, s, d, j, k, l).
3. Enjoy the drum sounds and experiment with different combinations to create your beats!

## Project Structure

- **index.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for handling button clicks, playing drum sounds, and adding button animations.
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that displays the drum kit interface, including buttons and the title.
